# Update cadence of the 3.x, 4.x and 6.x clients

Date: 2026-11-13. Settles App. E#301. Lab: the Linux 3.04, 4.04r2, 4.20r6 and 6.03r7 clients ran
natively under Xvfb, and the Windows 4.04r2 under Wine, against loopback lab servers. Timing
calls were logged with an `LD_PRELOAD` shim, walking was read at a decrypting proxy, and a GS1
weapon counted its own `timeout` fires **[lab][cap]**. The loop drivers were then read in the
binaries **[bin]**. Published as behaviour in squirelworks/seihai-core
`documentation/update-cadence.md` (PR #37, release 0.0.24) **[doc]**. No addresses.

**Answer: every build measured steps the game in fixed 50 ms steps, as 1.x to 2.31 do.** One
step is one render (about 20 fps in game), a walk step is 8 px (half a tile), so walking is 10
tiles a second. Between steps every client polls with a 1 ms sleep; none sleeps until the next
step **[lab]**.

## The loop

| Build | Loop | Step rule | Behind schedule | Tag |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3.04 | Torque's time manager | step when `now - last >= 50`, then `last = now` | no catch-up: a slow machine slows the game | [bin][lab] |
| 4.04r2, 4.20r6 | Torque's time manager, interval set to 50 at start-up | as 3.04 | as 3.04 | [bin][lab] |
| 6.03r7 | its own fixed-step loop | step when `now >= last + 50`, then `last += 50` | one catch-up step at most; more than two steps behind, it drops them (`last = now`) | [bin][lab] |

3.04's start-up interval is 5 ms, which is why its login screen renders at about 197 fps; the
game control sets 50 ms when it wakes, so in game it runs at 20 fps like the others. 6.03r7's
update also counts steps and runs a once-a-second dispatch every 20th step **[bin][lab]**.

## Measurements

Frame interval in ms (mean / median / 5th percentile / 95th percentile) **[lab]**:

| Build | Login | In game, walking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.04 | 5.07 / 4.79 / 4.57 / 5.79 (197 fps) | 50.06 / 49.89 / 49.19 / 50.90 (offline tutorial 50.08 / 50.03) |
| 4.04r2 (Linux) | 50.07 / 50.01 / 49.11 / 51.15 | 50.07 / 50.10 / 49.10 / 51.24 |
| 4.20r6 | 50.10 / 49.94 / 49.08 / 51.09 | 50.06 / 50.04 / 49.06 / 51.08 |
| 6.03r7 | 50.00 / 49.83 / 49.42 / 50.81 | 50.00 / 49.98 / 49.15 / 50.98 |
| 4.04r2 (Wine) | about 15 fps | 19.80 to 19.87 fps |

Walking, client-to-server `PLI_PLAYERPROPS` **[cap]**:

| Build | Props | Interval | Per message | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3.04 | X | 100.0 ms (99 to 101) | 1 tile (two steps) | 9.92 tiles/s |
| 4.04r2 (Linux) | X2 | 50.0 ms (49 to 51) | 8 px | 9.98 tiles/s |
| 4.20r6 | X2 | 50.0 ms (50 to 51) | 8 px | 9.98 tiles/s |
| 6.03r7 | X2 | 50.0 ms (49 to 51) | 8 px | 10.12 tiles/s |
| 4.04r2 (Wine) | X2 | 50.0 ms (49 to 51) | 8 px | 9.93 tiles/s |

Throttled so that each process ran 4 ms of every 100 ms, the step stayed 8 px and speed followed
the step rate: 3.04 online 10.3 fps (a message every 200 ms, 4.82 tiles/s); 4.04r2 9.7 fps,
4.64 tiles/s; 4.20r6 10.3 fps, 4.99 tiles/s; 4.04r2 under Wine about 7 fps, 3.78 tiles/s.
6.03r7 ran 17.1 fps, two steps about 1.6 ms apart in each 100 ms window (its one catch-up step),
8.24 tiles/s; with 200 ms windows, one step per window and 2.68 tiles/s, the rest dropped **[lab]**.

## GS1 `timeout` counts whole steps, rounded down

`timeout = 0.05` in a weapon fired 19.97 times a second on 3.04, 4.04r2 and 4.20r6, and 19.84
on 4.04r2 under Wine **[lab]**. On the C++ engine a GS1 `timeout` counts whole 50 ms steps,
**rounded down**, and a timeout of less than one whole step never fires. Swept on 4.04r2
(Linux), each value checked in the script the client received **[lab]**:

| `timeout` | Fires | Period |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.01, 0.049 | never | — |
| 0.05, 0.07 | 19.97/s, 19.95/s | 50 ms |
| 0.1, 0.12 | 9.99/s, 9.98/s | 100 ms |
| 0.15 | 6.66/s | 150 ms |

3.04 never fired `0.01`, and 4.20r6 never fired `0.01` or `0.025` **[lab]**. This agrees with the
static reading of Windows 4.04r2's legacy `timeout` (set × 20 + 0.0001, floored) in
[windows-404r2-500r7-static-2026-11-09.md](windows-404r2-500r7-static-2026-11-09.md#404r2-clocks).

`walk.gani` has 8 frames and no `WAIT`: one frame per step, a 0.4 s cycle (static read of the
file only) **[file]**.

## Not measured

- 6.03r7's script timer: the lab server sent no GS1 to clients after 5.0.0.7, had no GS2
  compiler, and its NPC server crashed when a 6.x client got a weapon.
- The `timeout` sweep on 5.x and 6.x, and on the 1.x and 2.x engines.
- Walk GANI frame timing at run time.
- Per-frame timestamps under Wine (averages only).
